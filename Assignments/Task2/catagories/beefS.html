    <h1>Beef Shawarma</h1>
    <p>Beef Shawarma recipe is made with tender juicy sliced beef that is marinated with the most aromatic shawarma spices then seared to perfection in a skillet stove top and served in pita wrap with veggies and tahini sauce — It’s always a favorite! Shawarma is a close relative to Greek gyros and Turkish döner kebab. Its a popular street food especially in the Middle East. This easy version is made with flank steak, wrapped in pita bread with vegetables & tahini sauce and garlic sauce too - a delicious mouthful of flavours and textures.</p>
