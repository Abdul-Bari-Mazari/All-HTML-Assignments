    <h1>Cone Ice Cream</h1>
    <p>An ice cream cone, poke (Ireland/Scotland) or cornet (England) is a brittle, cone-shaped pastry, usually made of a wafer similar in texture to a waffle, made so ice cream can be carried and eaten without a bowl or spoon, for example, the Hong Kong-style bubble cone. Many styles of cones are made, including pretzel cones and chocolate-coated cones (coated on the inside). The term ice cream cone can also refer, informally, to the cone with one or more scoops of ice cream on top.</p>
