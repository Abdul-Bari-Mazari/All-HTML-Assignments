    <h1>Kulfa Falooda</h1>
    <p>Basically kulfi or no churn, eggless, Pakistani ice cream made with full fat milk is placed on a bed of sweet basil seeds and falooda noodles, drizzled with rose syrup and/or khus syrup and garnished with nuts and dry fruits. A delicious North Indian summer dessert that is hard to resist especially on a hot sultry day.</p>
