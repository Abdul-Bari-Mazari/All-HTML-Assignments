    <h1>Black Tea</h1>
    <p>Black tea is made from the leaves of a bush called Camellia sinensis. It has caffeine as well as other stimulants and antioxidants. Lots of people in the U.S. drink it either hot or cold. It should always be steeped in hot water before it is cooled. Drinking black tea in moderate amounts (about 4 cups daily) is likely safe for most people. Drinking more than 4 cups of black tea daily is possibly unsafe. Drinking large amounts might cause side effects due to the caffeine content.</p>
